This is the blockchain part of a simple Web3 Votting App. This project is made to showcase what i have learned about Solidity and Smart Contracts.

The frontend part is in this repository: [https://github.com/chrisbgvt/blockchain-frontend-React](https://github.com/chrisbgvt/blockchain-frontend-React)

```shell
